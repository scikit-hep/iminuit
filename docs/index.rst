``iminuit`` is a Jupyter-friendly Python interface for the ``Minuit2`` C++ library maintained by CERN's `ROOT team <https://root.cern.ch>`_.

Minuit was designed to optimize statistical cost functions, for maximum-likelihood and least-squares fits. It provides the best-fit parameters and error estimates from likelihood profile analysis.

The iminuit package brings additional features:

- Builtin cost functions for statistical fits to N-dimensional data

  - Unbinned and binned maximum-likelihood + extended versions
  - `Template fits with error propagation <https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-022-11019-z>`_
  - Least-squares (optionally robust to outliers)
  - Gaussian penalty terms for parameters
  - Cost functions can be combined by adding them: ``total_cost = cost_1 + cost_2``
  - Visualization of the fit in Jupyter notebooks
- Support for SciPy minimizers as alternatives to Minuit's MIGRAD algorithm (optional)
- Support for Numba accelerated functions (optional)

Minimal dependencies
--------------------

``iminuit`` is promised to remain a lean package which only depends on ``numpy``, but additional features are enabled if the following optional packages are installed.

- ``numba``: Cost functions are partially JIT-compiled if ``numba`` is installed.
- ``matplotlib``: Visualization of fitted model for builtin cost functions
- ``ipywidgets``: Interactive fitting, see example below (also requires ``matplotlib``)
- ``scipy``: Compute Minos intervals for arbitrary confidence levels
- ``unicodeitplus``: Render names of model parameters in simple LaTeX as Unicode

**Lecture by Glen Cowan**

`In the exercises to his lecture for the KMISchool 2022 <https://github.com/KMISchool2022>`_, Glen Cowan shows how to solve statistical problems in Python with iminuit. You can find the lectures and exercises on the Github page, which covers both frequentist and Bayesian methods.

`Glen Cowan <https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ljQwt8QAAAAJ&view_op=list_works>`_ is a known for his papers and international lectures on statistics in particle physics, as a member of the Particle Data Group, and as author of the popular book `Statistical Data Analysis <https://www.pp.rhul.ac.uk/~cowan/sda/>`_.

In a nutshell
-------------

``iminuit`` can be used with a user-provided cost functions in form of a negative log-likelihood function or least-squares function. Standard functions are included in ``iminuit.cost``, so you don't have to write them yourself. The following example shows how to perform an unbinned maximum likelihood fit.

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    from iminuit import Minuit
    from iminuit.cost import UnbinnedNLL
    from scipy.stats import norm

    x = norm.rvs(size=1000, random_state=1)

    def pdf(x, mu, sigma):
        return norm.pdf(x, mu, sigma)

    # Negative unbinned log-likelihood, you can write your own
    cost = UnbinnedNLL(x, pdf)

    m = Minuit(cost, mu=0, sigma=1)
    m.limits["sigma"] = (0, np.inf)
    m.migrad()  # find minimum
    m.hesse()   # compute uncertainties

Interactive fitting
-------------------

``iminuit`` optionally supports an interactive fitting mode in Jupyter notebooks.

High performance when combined with numba
-----------------------------------------

When ``iminuit`` is used with cost functions that are JIT-compiled with `numba`_ (JIT-compiled pdfs are provided by `numba_stats`_ ), the speed is comparable to `RooFit`_ with the fastest backend. `numba`_ with auto-parallelization is considerably faster than the parallel computation in `RooFit`_.

More information about this benchmark is given `in the Benchmark section of the documentation <https://scikit-hep.org/iminuit/benchmark.html>`_.

Partner projects
----------------

* `numba_stats`_ provides faster implementations of probability density functions than scipy, and a few specific ones used in particle physics that are not in scipy.
* `boost-histogram`_ from Scikit-HEP provides fast generalized histograms that you can use with the builtin cost functions.
* `jacobi`_ provides a robust, fast, and accurate calculation of the Jacobi matrix of any transformation function and building a function for generic error propagation.

Versions
--------

**The current 2.x series has introduced breaking interfaces changes with respect to the 1.x series.**

All interface changes are documented in the `changelog`_ with recommendations how to upgrade. To keep existing scripts running, pin your major iminuit version to <2, i.e. ``pip install 'iminuit<2'`` installs the 1.x series.
