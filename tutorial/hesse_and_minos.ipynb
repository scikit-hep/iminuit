    "This is a topical tutorial. If you are new to iminuit, you should go through the basic tutorial first. \n",
    "\n",
    "iminuit (and C++ MINUIT) offers two major ways of computing parameter uncertainties from the cost function (which must be of least-squares form or negative log-likelihood), HESSE and MINOS. These have different pros and cons, on which we already touched in the basic tutorial. Here we want to go a bit deeper into the pros and cons and also try to reveal a bit of the math behind the two approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several sources which explain what HESSE and MINOS, in particular the MINUIT User's Guide (linked from the [iminuit documentation](https://iminuit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html)). The mathematical details are covered in F. James, \"Statistical Methods in Experimental Physics\", 2nd edition, World Scientific (2006)."

    "One can prove under general conditions in the asymptotic limit that a parameter estimate $\\hat\\theta$ obtained from the least-squares and the maximum-likelihood methods is normally distributed with minimum variance, given by the [Cramer-Rao lower bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%E2%80%93Rao_bound), which is the minimum for any unbiased estimator (these methods are asymptotically unbiased).\n",

    "If the data range is independent of $\\theta$, which we usually assume (but see F. James book for a counter example), we can swap integration over $x$ and differentiation with respect to $\\theta$.

    "#### A bit of history\n",
    "\n",
    "So what about these factors of $2$ and `errordef` in MINUIT that were mentioned above? These don't appear here. There are historical reasons for those. In the asymptotic limit, the least-squares cost function that corresponds to the log-likelihood is $Q = -2 \\ln\\! \\mathcal{L} - \\text{constants}$. MINUIT was originally developed with least-squares fits in mind, therefore its internal math assumes the $Q$ form. If the second derivatives are computed from $Q$, the constants are removed but the Hessian must be multiplied by a factor of two to get the right variance. Correspondingly, if the user puts in a negative log-likelihood function, the same procedure now introduces an extra factor of two $2$, which must be compensated by the `errordef` value of 0.5 for the negative log-likelihood.\n",

    "### Why is HESSE approximate\n",
    "\n",
    "We started out from Cramer-Rao bound, the asymptotic limit for the parameter variance. How fast the finite sample approaches the limit depends on the problem at hand. For normal distributed data, the bound is exact.\n",

    "### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "MINOS scans the likelihood along one parameter $\\theta_i$,  while minimizing the likelihood with respect to all other parameters $\\theta_k$ with $k \\ne i$. This is effectively the same as expressing the other parameter estimates as a function of $\\theta_i$, $\\hat \\theta_k(\\theta_i)$, and scanning the now one-dimensional negative log-likelihood $-\\ln \\mathcal{L}(\\theta_i; \\theta_k = \\hat \\theta_k(\\theta_i) , k\\ne i)$. This is called the [profile likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function#Profile_likelihood) for parameter $\\theta_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One follows this curve until $-\\ln \\mathcal{L}$ increases by `errordef` with respect to its minimum and stores the two corresponding values $\\theta^d_i$ and $\\theta^u_i$.

In multi-dimensional parameter space, the computation is comparably expensive due to the iterative steps of scanning and minimization.\n",

In the asymptotic limit, $-2 \\ln \\ell(\\vec\\theta)$ is $\\chi^2(k)$ distributed, where $k$ is the number of fitted parameters. For $k = 1$, the $\\chi^2$-interval $[0, 1)$ contains $68\\,\\%$ probability.

Therefore, during the scan they are not free. The profile likelihood is effectively a likelihood for a single parameter. Thus, $68\\,\\%$-intervals are also here obtained when the negative log-likelihood crosses the value $1/2$ above the minimum. \n",

    "### Why is MINOS approximate\n",
    "\n",
    "In some sources, the MINOS intervals are wrongly described as *exact*. They are not exact, because for finite samples the intervals do not necessarily have $68\\,\\%$ coverage probability, only in the asymptotic limit.\n",

    "One can argue that two approximations are involved in the HESSE calculation of an interval, but only one in the MINOS calculation. The MINOS intervals therefore could approach the asymptotic limit more rapidly. Seeing practical examples which demonstrate this would be very interesting."
