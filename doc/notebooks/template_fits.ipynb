    "In applications we are interested in separating a signal component from background components, we often fit parameteric models to data. Sometimes constructing a parametric model for some component is difficult. In that case, one fits a template instead which may be obtained from simulation or from a calibration sample in which a pure component can be isolated.\n",

The template is now also estimated from a sample (be it simulated or a calibration sample), and the uncertainty associated to that can be substantial.

The combined likelihood for the problem is then combines the estimation of the template yields with the estimation of unknown templates.\n",

Unfortunately, their approach still requires numerically solving a non-linear equation per bin. The finite accuracy of the non-linear solver introduces discontinuities in the log-likelihood that confuse Minuit, as noted by [Conway, PHYSTAT 2011, https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0354](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1103.0354). To address this, Conway proposes a simplified treatment where the uncertainty in the template is described by a multiplicative factor constrained by a Gaussian. With this simplification, the optimal nuisance parameters can be found by bin-by-bin by solving a quadratic equation which has only one allowed solution that can be found analytically. Conway's method and two other approximate methods are implemented in the built-in Template cost function (see documentation for details)."

    "The performance of the BBL methods is comparable to that of the BB method. In all cases, biases are small and the estimated variance is close to the actual variance. When the experiments are repeated with a high number of toy simulations, we find that the HPD and ASY methods perform slightly better than Conway's method."
