Unbinned fits are inefficient when the samples are very large and can become numerically unstable, too. Binned fits are a better choice then.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function for an unbinned maximum-likelihood fit is really simple, it is the sum of the logarithm of the pdf evaluated at each sample point (times -1 to turn maximimization into minimization). You can easily write this yourself, but a naive implementation will suffer from instabilities when the pdf becomes locally zero. Our implementation mitigates the instabilities to some extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the unbinned fit you need to provide the pdf of the model, which must be vectorized (a numpy ufunc). The pdf must be normalized, which means that the integral over the sample value range must be a constant for any combination of model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model pdf in this case is a linear combination of the normal and the exponential pdfs. The parameters are $z$ (the weight), $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ of the normal distribution and $\\tau$ of the exponential. The cost function detects the parameter names.\n",
