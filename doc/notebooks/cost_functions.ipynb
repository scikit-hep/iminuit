Unbinned fits are inefficient when the samples are very large and can become numerically unstable, too. Binned fits are a better choice then.\n",

    "The cost function for an unbinned maximum-likelihood fit is really simple, it is the sum of the logarithm of the pdf evaluated at each sample point (times -1 to turn maximization into minimization).
