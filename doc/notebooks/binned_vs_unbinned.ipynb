    "# Binned vs. unbinned fits\n",
    "\n",
    "We compare binned with unbinned fit applied to a toy example of a gaussian signal peak over exponential background.\n",
    "\n",
    "For one-dimensional data, binned fit are preferred. They are usually considerably faster than an unbinned fit and more numerically stable. For multi-dimensional data, however, an unbinned fit can be faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a common misconception that binned fits are inherently biased. This idea originates from the past when it was common (at least in particle physics) to fit binned data with the least-squares method, which is indeed biased, see [Dembinski, Schmelling, Waldi, *Application of the Iterated Weighted Least-Squares Fit to counting experiments*, NIM A 940 (2019) 135-141](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2019.05.086). That bias can be completely avoided, however, if the fit uses the maximum-likelihood method and a Poisson distribution to describe the observed bin contents as a function of the predicted ones, and if the model prediction for a bin content is properly computed by integrating over the model density, instead of computing it from the density at the bin center times the bin width. The cost functions `BinnedNLL` and `ExtendedBinnedNLL` from `iminuit.cost` use the correct calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there is no need to worry bias, but some information is lost in the binning process - the densities of events inside each bin. This loss can be made negligible by making the bin width small enough. How small the bins have to be depends on the sensitivity of the model parameter on this particular loss of information. In this tutorial we demonstrate this and also demonstrate the difference in run-time of unbinned and binned fits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusions:** With only 20 bins, the binned fit reached an accuracy for the signal yield that is comparable to the unbinned fit. With 50 bins, also all shape parameters have uncertainties that are less than 5 % larger than those in the unbinned fit. At the same time, the binned fit is much faster. Even with 200 bins, the binned fit is two orders of magnitude faster than the unbinned fit. In practice, this is a huge difference, 3 seconds vs. 5 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try to run this notebook with a data sample contains less points, then the difference will not be as dramatic."
