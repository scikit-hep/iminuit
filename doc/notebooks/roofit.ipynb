    "In this tutorial, we show how to create a negative log-likelihood function with the [RooFit framework](https://root.cern/manual/roofit/) and minimize it with iminuit. \n",
    "\n",
    "RooFit is a powerful fitting framework developed by CERN's ROOT team.\n",
    "RooFit is very powerful and sophisticated, but there are a few reasons to use iminuit instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "- RooFit documention is extensive, but lacking in important places\n",
    "- RooFit interfaces are not Pythonic, they mimic the C++ interfaces (which are also dated)\n",
    "- Errors are difficult to understand and debug since RooFit is internally executing C++ code\n",
    "- You may experience segmentation faults when using RooFit from Python due to bugs in the ROOT Python layer (problems with handling life-times of dynamic C++ objects in Python correctly)\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, you may consider to transition to iminuit and its cost functions for your project. As a first step, you want to convince yourself that iminuit gives you the same fitting result as you get from RooFit. "
