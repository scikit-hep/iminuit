    "\n",
    "The `Minuit` class can call SciPy minimizers implemented in `scipy.optimize.minimize` as alternatives to the standard Migrad minimizer to minimize the cost function. The SciPy minimizers may perform better or worse on some problems. You can give them a try when you are not satisfied with Migrad.\n",

    "More importantly, the SciPy minimizers support additional features that Migrad lacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Migrad does not allow one to use an externally computed hessian matrix.\n",
    "* Migrad does not allow one to use additional constraints of the form $\\vec a \\leq f(\\vec x) \\leq \\vec b$ in the minimization, where $\\vec x$ is the parameter vector of length $m$, $f$ is an arbitrary function $\\mathcal{R}^m \\rightarrow \\mathcal{R}^k$ and $\\vec a, \\vec b$ are vector bounds with length $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy comes with a variety of minimization algorithms and some of them support these features. The ability to use constraints is interesting for HEP applications. In particular, it allows us to ensure that a pdf as a function of the parameters is always positive. This can be ensured sometimes with suitable limits on the parameters, but not always.\n",
