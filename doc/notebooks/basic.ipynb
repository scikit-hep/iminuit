                "`iminuit` is a Python frontend to the `Minuit2` library in C++, an integrated software that combines a local minimizer (called MIGRAD) and two error calculators (called HESSE and MINOS). You provide it an analytical function, which accepts one or several parameters, and an initial guess of the parameter values. It will then find a local minimum of this function starting from the initial guess. In that regard, iminuit minimizer is like other local minimizers, like those in `scipy.optimize`.\n",
                "\n",
                "In addition, iminuit has the ability to compute **uncertainty estimates** for model parameters. `iminuit` was designed to solve statistics problems, where uncertainty estimates are an essential part of the result. The two ways of computing uncertainty estimates, HESSE and MINOS, have different advantages and disadvantages.\n",

                "`iminuit` is the successor of `pyminuit`. If you used `pyminuit` before, you will find iminuit very familiar. An important feature of `iminuit` (and `pyminuit`) is that it uses introspection to detect the parameter names of your function. This is very convenient, especially when you work interactively in a Jupyter notebook. It also provides special output routines for Jupyter notebooks to pretty print the fit results, as you will see below."
