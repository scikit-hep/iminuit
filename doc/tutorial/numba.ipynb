    "# Acceleration with Numba\n",

    "We show how the computation of cost functions can be dramatically accelerated with numba's JIT compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "The run-time of iminuit is usually dominated by the execution time of the cost function. To get good performance, it recommended to use array arthimetic and scipy and numpy functions in the body of the cost function. Python loops should be avoided, but if they are unavoidable, [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) can help. Numba can also parallelize numerical calculations to make full use of multi-core CPUs and even do computations on the GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This tutorial shows how one can generate faster pdfs with Numba. Before you start to write your own pdf, please check whether one is already implemented in the [numba_stats library](https://github.com/HDembinski/numba-stats). If you have a pdf that is not included there, please consider contributing it to numba_stats."
