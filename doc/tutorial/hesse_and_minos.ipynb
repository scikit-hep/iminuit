    "iminuit (and C++ MINUIT) offers two major ways of computing parameter uncertainties from the cost function (which must be of least-squares form or negative log-likelihood), HESSE and MINOS. These have different pros and cons, on which we already touched in the basic tutorial. Here we want to go a bit deeper into the pros and cons and also try to reveal a bit of the math behind the two approaches.\n",

    "\n",
    "So what about these factors of $2$ and `errordef` in MINUIT that were mentioned above? These don't appear here. There are historical reasons for those. In the asymptotic limit, the least-squares cost function that corresponds to the log-likelihood is $Q = -2 \\ln\\! \\mathcal{L} - \\text{constants}$. MINUIT was originally developed with least-squares fits in mind, therefore its internal math assumes the $Q$ form. If the second derivatives are computed from $Q$, the constants are removed but the Hessian must be multiplied by a factor of two to get the right variance. Correspondingly, if the user puts in a negative log-likelihood function, the same procedure now introduces an extra factor of two $2$, which must be compensated by the `errordef` value of 0.5 for the negative log-likelihood.\n",

    "### Why is HESSE approximate\n",

    "\n",
    "MINOS scans the likelihood along one parameter $\\theta_i$,  while minimizing the likelihood with respect to all other parameters $\\theta_k$ with $k \\ne i$. This is effectively the same as expressing the other parameter estimates as a function of $\\theta_i$, $\\hat \\theta_k(\\theta_i)$, and scanning the now one-dimensional negative log-likelihood $-\\ln \\mathcal{L}(\\theta_i; \\theta_k = \\hat \\theta_k(\\theta_i) , k\\ne i)$. This is called the [profile likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function#Profile_likelihood) for parameter $\\theta_i$.\n",

The interval $(\\theta^d_i, \\theta^u_i)$ has $68\\,\\%$ coverage probability in the asymptotic limit. In multi-dimensional parameter space, the computation is comparably expensive due to the iterative steps of scanning and minimization.\n",

Therefore, during the scan they are not free. The profile likelihood is effectively a likelihood for a single parameter.
