2.12.1 (July 1, 2022)
---------------------

Fixes
~~~~~
- ``cost.BarlowBeestonLite``: method "hpd" has been modified to fix performance in cases where bins are not dominated by a single template

2.12.0 (June 21, 2022)
----------------------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New cost function ``cost.BarlowBeestonLite`` for template fits with correct uncertainty propagation for templates obtained from simulation or sWeighted data, written together with @AhmedAbdelmotteleb
- Formerly private chi2 utility cost functions (``cost.poisson_chi2``, etc.), are now part of public API
- Support custom grid in ``Minuit.profile``, ``iminuit.mncontour``, ``iminuit.contour``

- ``subtract_min`` setting is no longer ignored by ``Minuit.draw_contour``

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New study about template fits

Other
~~~~~
- ``Minuit`` no longer warns when a function is used that has no ``errordef``
  attribute and ``Minuit.errordef`` is not explicitly set. The function is
  assumed to be chi-square-like up to an arbitrary constant, unless ``errordef``
  is explicitly set to something else.
- More type correctness in API, better hiding of private objects in library
- Option to use external pybind11, by @henryiii
- Update to pybind11-v2.9.2, by @henryiii

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- All builtin cost functions now support multidimensional data
- ``Matrix.to_dict`` was added for symmetry with ``BasicValueView.to_dict``
- For long-running fits, total runtime is now shown in ``FMin`` display and total runtime can be accessed via property ``FMin.time``

Fixes

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ``UnbinnedNLL`` and ``ExtendedUnbinnedNLL`` now support models that predict the
  ``logpdf`` instead of the ``pdf`` when the extra keyword ``log=True`` is set; when
  it is possible, using the ``logpdf`` instead of the ``pdf`` for fitting is faster
  and numerically more stable

2.9.0 (January 7, 2022)
-----------------------

Fixes
~~~~~
- ``Minuit.draw_mncontour`` now works with matplotlib >= 3.5
- Builtin cost functions now work correctly when the mask is set and data is updated on
  the existing cost function

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Builtin cost functions are now more performant when used with weighted binned data

Other
~~~~~
- Wheels for Python 3.10, by @henryiii
- Bump pybind11 to 2.9.0, by @henryiii

2.8.4 (October 11, 2021)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New tutorial on fitting PDFs that depend on a conditional variable
- Fixed JAX tutorial, adapting to change in their interface
- Extended documentation of cost functions

2.8.3 (September 3, 2021)
-------------------------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ``util.propagate`` now discriminates between diverging derivates (using the value NaN
  for the derivate) and non-converging derivatives (using the best value computed so far
  for the derivative)

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixes for faulty LaTeX rendering in some tutorials

Other
~~~~~
- Support cross-compiling of ARM on Conda, by @henryiii

2.8.2 (August 15, 2021)

  compilation against Python-3.10 on Windows, co-authored with @cgohlke

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Docstring improved for ``Minuit.mncontour``, advice added on how to draw closed curve
  with points returned by ``Minuit.mncontour``
- Docstring improved for ``Minuit.draw_mncontour``, parameters and returned objects are
  now properly documented

2.8.1 (August 4, 2021)
----------------------

Other
~~~~~
- @henryiii added Apple Silicon wheels
- @odidev added Linux aarch64 wheels

2.8.0 (July 25, 2021)
---------------------

Minor API change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ``Minuit.mncontour`` now raises ``RuntimeError`` instead of ``ValueError`` if it is
  not called at a valid minimum point

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ``Minuit.mncontour`` can now be called at any point without running a minimiser before,
  similar to ``Minuit.minos``

Fixes
~~~~~
- ``Minuit.mncontour`` used to fail if called twice in a row

2.7.0 (July 4, 2021)
--------------------

Minor API change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- If ``Minuit.hesse`` is called when ``Minuit.fmin`` is ``None``, an instance
  ``Minuit.fmin`` is now created. If Hesse fails, the code does not raise an exception
  anymore, since now the error state can be accessed as usual from the ``Minuit.fmin``
  object. Users who relied on the exception should check ``Minuit.fmin`` from now on.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ``Minuit.scipy`` can be used to minimise with SciPy algorithms. These may succeed
  when ``Minuit.migrad`` fails and support additional features. Some algorithms
  allow one to pass a function that returns the Hessian matrix (which may be computed
  analytically or via automatic differentiation provided by other libraries like JAX).
  Other algorithms support minimisation under arbitrary non-linear constraints.
- ``util.FMin`` has new html/text representations; the field ``Valid parameters`` was
  removed, a title with the name of the minimisation method was added
- ``Minuit.tol`` now accepts the values 0 and ``None``, the latter resets the default
- Builtin cost functions now support models that return arrays in long double precision
  ``float128``. In this case, all computations inside the cost function are also done in
  higher precision.
- Builtin cost functions now raise a warning if the user-defined model does not return
  a numpy array

Fixes
~~~~~
- Calling ``Minuit.migrad`` with a call limit under some circumstances used much more
  calls than expected and did not report that the call limit was reached
  (patch submitted to ROOT)
- ``Minuit.hesse`` no longer sets the status of the FunctionMinimum unconditionally
  to valid if it was invalid before
- Repeated calls to ``Minuit.hesse`` no longer accumulate calls and eventually exhaust
  the call limit, the call counter is now properly reset
- Calling ``Minuit.minos`` repeatedly now does not recompute the Hessian and avoids
  a bug that used to exhaust the call limit before in this case

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Tutorial notebooks are now fully integrated into the HTML documentation
- A tutorial on using constrained minimisation from SciPy for HEP task was added

Other
~~~~~
- ``util.BasicView`` is now a proper abstract base class

2.6.1 (May 13, 2021)
--------------------

Fixes
~~~~~
- Calling ``Minuit.fixed[...] = False`` on parameter that was not fixed before
  lead to undefined behaviour in Minuit2 C++ code (patch submitted to ROOT)

Other
~~~~~
- Upgrade Minuit2 C++ code to latest ROOT master with simplified internal class
  structure and class tags replaced with enums

2.6.0 (May 2, 2021)
-------------------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Builtin cost functions now report the number of data points with the attribute
  ``Cost.ndata``
- New attribute ``Minuit.ndof`` returns the degrees of freedom if the cost function
  reports it or NaN
- New attribute ``FMin.reduced_chi2`` to report the reduced chi2 of the fit; returns
  NaN if the reduced chi2 cannot be computed for the cost function, in case of unbinned
  maximum-likelihood or when the attribute ``Cost.ndata`` is missing

2.5.0 (April 30, 2021)
----------------------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ``util.merge_signatures`` added based on ``merge_user_func`` from ``probfit``,
  by @mbaak
- ``util.make_with_signature`` added to create new functions with renamed arguments
- ``util.BasicView.to_dict`` added, by @watsonjj
- ``util.BasicView`` and ``util.Matrix`` now supports element selection with sequences
  like ``numpy.ndarray``
- ``util.propagate`` to error propagate covariance matrices from one vector space to
  another (Jacobi matrix is computed numerically)

Fixes
~~~~~
- ``util.BasicView`` now supports slices of the form ``a[:len(a)]`` or ``a[:M]`` with
  ``M > len(a)`` like other Python containers
- ``util.Matrix`` now returns a square matrix when it is used with a slice or item
  selection
- Missing comma in BibTeX entry shown in CITATION.rst, by Ludwig Neste

Other
~~~~~
- ``util.describe`` returns list instead of tuple

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  ``Minuit.draw_mnprofile``, and ``Minuit.draw_contour`` can now be called with
  ``subtract_min=True`` even if ``Minuit.fmin`` is None
- ``__version__`` now also displays the ROOT version of the C++ Minuit2 library

- Matrix display now shows numbers correctly even if entries differ in magnitude

Other
~~~~~

- Fixes for ``conda`` builds on Windows platform with ``msvc``, by @henryiii
- Updated and unified documentation on how to cite iminuit
- ``print()`` applied to ``Minuit.params``, ``Minuit.merrors``, ``Minuit.covariance``,
  ``Minuit.fmin`` now returns the pretty text version again instead of the
  ``repr`` version

2.0.0 (December 7, 2020)
------------------------

This is a breaking change for  Interface that was deprecated in 1.x has been removed. In addition, breaking changes were made to the interface to arrive at a clean minimal state that is easier to learn, safer to use, and ready for the long-term future. **To keep existing scripts running, pin your major iminuit version to <2**, i.e. ``pip install 'iminuit<2'`` installs the 1.x series.

Under the hood, Cython was replaced with pybind11 to generate the bindings to the C++ Minuit2 library. This simplified the code considerably (Cython is bad at generating correct C++ bindings, while it is a breeze with pybind11).

Removed and changed interface (breaking changes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ``Minuit.__init__``

  - Keywords ``error_*``, ``fix_*``, and ``limit_*`` were removed; assign to ``Minuit.errors``, ``Minuit.fixed``, and ``Minuit.limits`` to set initial step sizes, fix parameters, and set limits
  - Keyword ``pedantic`` was removed; parameters must be initialised with values now or an error is raised
  - Keyword ``errordef`` was removed; assign to ``Minuit.errordef`` to set the error definition of the cost function or better create an attribute called ``errordef`` on the cost function, Minuit uses this attribute if it exists
  - Keyword ``throw_nan`` was removed; assign to ``Minuit.throw_nan`` instead
  - Keyword ``print_level`` was removed; assign to ``Minuit.print_level`` instead
  - Setting starting values with positional parameters is now allowed, e.g. ``Minuit(my_fcn, 1, 2)`` initialises the first parameters to 1 and the second to 2
  - Keyword ``use_array_call`` was removed; call type is inferred from the initialisation value, if it is a sequence, the array call is used (see next item below)

- ``Minuit.from_array_func`` was removed; use ``Minuit(some_numpy_function, starting_array)`` instead
- ``Minuit.args`` was removed, use ``Minuit.values[:]`` to get the current parameter values as a tuple
- ``Minuit.values``

  - Now behaves like an array instead of like a dict, i.e. methods like ``keys()`` and ``items()`` are gone and ``for x in minuit.values`` iterates over the values
  - Item access via index and via parameter name is supported, e.g. ``minuit.values[0]`` and ``minuit.values["a"]`` access the value for the first parameter "a"
  - Broadcasting is supported, e.g. ``minuit.values = 0`` sets all parameter values to 0
  - Slicing is supported for setting and getting several parameter values at once

- ``Minuit.errors``: see changes to ``Minuit.values``
- ``Minuit.fixed``: see changes to ``Minuit.values``
- ``Minuit.migrad``

  - Keyword ``resume`` was removed; use ``Minuit.reset`` instead
  - Keyword ``precision`` was removed; use ``Minuit.precision`` instead
  - Return value is now ``self`` instead of ``self.fmin, self.params``

- ``Minuit.hesse``: Return value is now ``self`` instead of ``self.params``
- ``Minuit.minos``

  - Now accepts more than one positional argument (which must be parameter names) and computes Minos errors for them
  - Return value is now ``self`` instead of ``self.merrors``
  - ``sigma`` keyword replaced with ``cl`` to set confidence level (requires scipy)

- ``Minuit.mncontour`` and ``Minuit.draw_mncontour``

  - ``sigma`` keyword replaced with ``cl`` to set confidence level (requires scipy)
  - ``numpoints`` keyword replaced with ``size``
  - Keyword arguments are keyword-only
  - Return value is reduced to just the contour points as a numpy array

- ``Minuit.mnprofile`` and ``Minuit.draw_mnprofile``

  - ``sigma`` keyword replaced with ``cl`` to set confidence level (requires scipy)
  - ``numpoints`` keyword replaced with ``size``
  - Keyword arguments are keyword-only

- ``Minuit.profile`` and ``Minuit.draw_profile``

  - ``bins`` keyword replaced with ``size``
  - Keyword arguments are keyword-only

- ``Minuit.fitarg`` was removed; to copy state use ``m2.values = m1.values; m2.limits = m1.limits`` etc. (Minuit object may become copyable and pickleable in the future)
- ``Minuit.matrix`` was removed; see ``Minuit.covariance``
- ``Minuit.covariance`` instead of a dict-like class is now an enhanced subclass of numpy.ndarray (util.Matrix) with the features:

  - Behaves like a numpy.ndarray in numerical computations
  - Rich display of the matrix in ipython and Jupyter notebook
  - Element access via parameter names in addition to indices, e.g. Minuit.covariance["a", "b"] access the covariance of parameters "a" and "b"
  - ``Minuit.covariance.correlation()`` computes the correlation matrix from the covariance matrix and returns it
  - Has always full rank, number of rows and columns is equal to the number of parameters even when some are fixed; elements corresponding to fixed parameters are set to zero in the matrix

- ``Minuit.gcc`` was removed for lack of a known use-case (submit an issue if you need this, then it will come back)
- ``Minuit.is_clean_state`` was removed; use ``Minuit.fmin is None`` instead
- ``Minuit.latex_param`` was removed; LaTeX and other table formats can be produced by passing the output of ``minuit.params.to_table()`` to the external ``tabulate`` module available on PyPI
- ``Minuit.latex_initial_param`` was removed; see ``Minuit.latex_param``
- ``Minuit.latex_matrix`` was removed; LaTeX and other table formats can be produced by passing the output of ``minuit.covariance.to_table()`` to the external ``tabulate`` module available on PyPI
- ``Minuit.ncalls_total`` was replaced with ``Minuit.nfcn``
- ``Minuit.ngrads_total`` was replaced with ``Minuit.ngrad``
- ``Minuit.np_covariance`` is now obsolete and was removed; see ``Minuit.covariance``

- ``Minuit.np_merrors`` was removed; use ``Minuit.merrors`` or ``Minuit.params`` instead
- ``Minuit.use_array_call`` was removed, ``Minuit.fcn`` and ``Minuit.grad`` always require parameter values in form of sequences, e.g. ``minuit.fcn((1, 2))``
- ``util.FMin`` is now a data class with read-only attributes, the dict-like interface was removed (methods like ``keys()``, ``items()`` are gone)

  - ``tolerance`` attribute was replaced with ``edm_goal``, since the effect of ``tolerance`` varies for ``Minuit.migrad`` and ``Minuit.simplex``, ``edm_goal`` is the actual value of interest
  - Property ``nfcn`` is the total number of function calls so far
  - Property ``ngrad`` is the total number of gradient calls so far
  - ``ngrad_total`` was removed and replaced by ``ngrad``
  - ``nfcn_total`` was removed and replaced by ``nfcn``
  - ``up`` was removed and replaced by ``errordef`` (to have one consistent name)
  - ``util.MError`` is now a data class, dict-like interface was removed (see ``util.FMin``)

- ``util.InitialParamWarning`` was removed since it is no longer used
- ``util.MigradResult`` was removed since it is no longer used
- ``util.arguments_from_inspect`` was removed from the public interface, it lives on as a private function

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ``Minuit`` class

  - Now a class with `__slots__`; assigning to a non-existent attribute (e.g. because of a typo) now raises an error
  - Parameter names in Unicode are now fully supported, e.g. ``def fcn(Œ±, Œ≤): ...`` works
  - New method ``simplex`` to minimise the function with the Nelder-Mead method
  - New method ``scan`` to minimise the function with a brute-force grid search (not recommended and infeasible for fits with more than a few free parameters)
  - New method ``reset`` reverts to the initial parameter state
  - New property ``limits``, an array-like view of the current parameter limits; allows to query and set limits with a behaviour analog to ``values``, ``errors`` etc.; broadcasting is supported, e.g. ``minuit.limits = (0, 1)`` makes all parameters bounded between 0 and 1 and ``minuit.limits = None`` removes all limits
  - New property ``precision`` to change the precision that Minuit assumes for internal calculations of derivatives
  - Support for calling numba-compiled functions that release the GIL (slightly more efficient already today and may be used in the future to compute derivatives in parallel)
  - Now pretty-prints itself in Jupyter notebooks and the ipython shell, showing the equivalent of ``Minuit.fmin``, ``Minuit.params``, ``Minuit.merrors``, ``Minuit.covariance``, whatever is available

- ``util.Param`` class

  - New attribute ``merror``, which either returns a tuple of the lower and upper Minos error or None
  - All attributes are now documented inline with docstrings which can be investigated with ``pydoc`` and ``help()`` in the REPL

- ``util.Params`` class

  - New method ``to_table``, which returns a format that can be consumed by the external ``tabulate`` Python module

- ``util.FMin`` class

  - New attribute ``ngrad`` which is the number of gradient calls so far
  - New attribute ``has_parameters_at_limit`` which returns True if any parameter values is close to a limit
  - All attributes are now documented inline with docstrings which can be investigated with ``pydoc`` and ``help()`` in the REPL

- ``util.Matrix`` class

  - New method ``to_table``, which returns a format that can be consumed by the external ``tabulate`` Python module
  - New method ``correlation``, which computes and returns the correlation matrix (also a ``util.Matrix``)

Bug-fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Calling ``Minuit.hesse`` when all parameters were fixed now raises an error instead of producing a segfault
- Many life-time/memory leak issues in the iminuit interface code should be resolved now, even when there is an exception during the minimisation (there can still be errors in the underlying C++ Minuit2 library, which would have to be fixed upstream)

Other changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Several attributes were replaced with properties to avoid accidental overrides and to protect against assigning invalid input, e.g. ``Minuit.tol`` and ``Minuit.errordef`` only accept positive numbers
- Documentation update and clean up
- Logging messages from C++ Minuit2, which are produced when ``Minuit.print_level`` is set to 1 to 3 are now properly shown inside the notebook or the Python session instead of being printed to the terminal
- Assigning to ``Minuit.print_level`` changes the logging threshold for all current and future ``Minuit`` instances in the current Python session, this is not really desired but cannot be avoided since the C++ logger is a global variable
- docstring parsing for ``util.describe`` was rewritten; behaviour of ``describe`` for corner cases of functions with positional and variable number of positional and keyword arguments are now well-defined
- iminuit now has 100 % line coverage by unit tests

1.3 (July 5, 2018)
------------------

- iminuit 1.3 is a big release, there are many improvements. All users are encouraged to update.
- Python 2.7 as well as Python 3.5 or later are supported, on Linux, MacOS and Windows.
- Source packages are available for PyPI/pip and we maintain binary package for conda (see :ref:`install`).
- The bundled Minuit C++ library has been updated to the latest version (takend from ROOT 6.12.06).
- The documentation has been mostly re-written. To learn about iminuit and all the new features,
  read the :ref:`tutorials`.
- Numpy is now a core dependency, required to compile iminuit.
- For Numpy users, a second callback function interface and a ``Minuit.from_array_func`` constructor
  was added, where the parameters are passed as an array.
- Results are now also available as Numpy arrays, e.g. ``np_values``, ``np_errors`` and ``np_covariance``.
- A wrapper function ``minimize`` for the MIGRAD optimiser was added,
  that has the same arguments and return value format as ``scipy.optimize.minimize``.
- Support for analytical gradients has been added, users can pass a ``grad`` callback function.
  This works, but for unknown reasons doesn't lead to performance improvements yet.
  If you can help debug or fix this issue, please comment `here <https://github.com/scikit-hep/iminuit/issues/252>`__.
- Several issues have been fixed.

Previously
----------

- For iminuit releases before v1.3, we did not fill a change log.
- To summarise: the first iminuit release was v1.0 in Dec 2012.
  In 2013 there were several releases, and in Jan 2014 the v1.1.1 release
  was made. After that development was mostly inactive, except for the
  v1.2 release in Nov 2015.
